The WTF App is a "ground-breaking" app that lets users search for where to eat, where to drink and what is going in Nashville for any date they are visiting. Basically, it just lets a user figure out WTF is going on in Nashville.

Simply select the date you are visiting on the datepicker calendar and ouila! The App displays restaurants, bars, and concerts/events happening on that date. 

## WTF utilizes the following:
-Yelp Fusion API
-TicketMaster API
-AJAX
-Bootstrap 
-Materialize
-Animate.css
-Firebase.
